Given an array of n integers with any of these integers appearing any number of times. Write a
program to sort these n integers in O(nlogm) time, where m is number of distinct elements in
array.


Hint: Use AVL tree. The idea is to extend tree node to have count of keys also. Each node in the
tree is of the following type.

Struct node{
int key;
int count; //number of times a key appears in the array
int height;
struct node *left;
struct node *right;
}


Input Format:
• The first line of the input contains an integer n ∈ [1, 100], number of elements in the array.
• Second line containing space separated integers of the array. The integers are in the range
[−106, 106]

Output Format:
• Single line containing space separated integers of the given input array in non-decreasing
order.



Sample Input:
12

100 12 100 1 1 12 100 1 12 100 1 1
Sample Output:
1 1 1 1 1 12 12 12 100 100 100 100
