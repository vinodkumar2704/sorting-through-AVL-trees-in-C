Sorting of numbers in O(nlogm) time using AVL tree in C



Given an array of n integers with any of these integers appearing any number of times. A
program to sort these n integers in O(nlogm) time, where m is number of distinct elements in
array.
Note: Use AVL tree. The idea is to extend tree node to have count of keys also. Each node in the
tree is of the following type.
